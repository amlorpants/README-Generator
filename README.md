# Amy's README generator

this is my module 9 challenge repo

## Description

This challenge required me to create README generator. I had to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the inquirer package. I then had to create a video of the typical user flow through my application. This included views of the prompts and the responses after their selection as well as a look at the final generated README!
